# Neural Network Three Link Manipulator Using MATLAB
<strong>Intro</strong>

In ‘A study of neural network based inverse kinematics solution for three-joint robot’ (Köker 2014), the authors propose using backpropagation to retrieve the inverse kinematics for a three-joint robot. They state that the advantage is that the artificial neural network uses shorter calculations (in comparison to inverse kinematic solutions which is time consuming) and therefore less computation power.
